            <h1>Messenger</h1>
            <p>First, you need to create the characters that will appear on Messenger. Go to the "characters" folder. Once you've done that, go to "talks" to create your conversations.</p>

            <!-- ========== CHARACTERS ========== -->
            <h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>
            <p>Open the characters.txt file located in <code>messenger/characters/characters.txt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Girlfriend "Sarah" (gf.png) = gf

                    <td><code>= gf</code></td>

            <div class="info-box info">
                <div class="info-box-title">Avatar Images</div>
                <p>The character images must be placed in the "avatar" folder where characters.txt is located.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- ========== CONVERSATIONS ========== -->
            <h2 id="conversations">Conversations</h2>
            <p>Your first conversation should be in <code>start.txt</code> in the <code>talks/</code> folder.</p>

            <h3>Conversation Structure</h3>
<pre><code>Sarah
mc : Hey $gf!
gf : Hey $mc, how are you?
mc : Listen, I'll show you an example of sending a photo:
mc : $pics = 1.png
gf : Yes, I know, and here's an example of a video:
Girlfriend : $vids = 1.mp4
mc : Oh, that's great, I think I can even make a voice memo—
gf : Absolutely.
Girlfriend: $audio = 1.mp3
mc : We've covered sending multimedia content, let's see the rest in another conversation.
$talks = lovepath/1.txt</code></pre>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Line</th>
                    <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>Sarah</code></td>
                    <td>The first line refers to the person with whom you are having the conversation. You can have a conversation with several people by separating their names with commas (e.g., Sarah, Robert, Lisa)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>mc : text</code></td>
                    <td>To make the MC speak, use "mc: TEXT" (respect the spaces)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>gf : text</code></td>
                    <td>To make a protagonist speak, use "Name: TEXT" (or "Abbreviation: TEXT")</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Multi-line Messages</h3>
            <p>As long as another protagonist does not speak, all the text you enter, including line breaks, will be in a single message:</p>

<pre><code>mc : Hey!
gf : Hey John, hwr?

Did you do what I asked you to do?

I haven't heard from you.
mc : I completely forgot.</code></pre>

            <p>This will only result in three messages.</p>

            <h3>Navigation Between Conversations</h3>
            <p>Once you have finished the conversation and want to start a new one, enter <code>$talks = PATH/NAME.txt</code></p>

            <p>From the "talks" folder, you can create subfolders. For example, if you create "lovepath/chapter1/1.txt", the call will be:</p>
<pre><code>$talks = lovepath/chapter1/1.txt</code></pre>

            <p>If the MC already has a conversation with the person(s) in this new conversation, it will be reused and moved to the top of the MC's list, like a "new message" in WhatsApp.</p>

I need to try to dig deeper.

            <!-- ========== CHOICES ========== -->
            <h2 id="choices">Choice System</h2>

            <h3>Fake Choices (No Impact)</h3>
            <p>This function allows the MC to submit a response of their choice, but it has no impact on the story. It is intended to enhance immersion.</p>

<pre><code>$fake.choices =
Choice 1. $/
Choice 2. $/
Choice 3.</code></pre>

            <div class="info-box info">
                <div class="info-box-title">Syntax</div>
                <p>You can include as many choices as you wish, but it is important that each line ends with <code>$/</code>, except for the last one.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Custom Responses</h4>
            <p>You can add a personalized response from an interlocutor for each choice. When the player selects that choice, the specified character will automatically reply with the custom message.</p>

<pre><code>gf : What do you want to do tonight?
$fake.choices =
Watch a movie. $/ [gf : Great idea! I'll prepare the popcorn!]
Go out for dinner. $/ [gf : Perfect, I know a nice restaurant!]
Stay home and relax. $/ [gf : Sounds cozy, I like it.]
I don't know, you choose.</code></pre>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Element</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>[gf : message]</code></td>
                    <td>Custom response from a character. Use their abbreviation (gf, be, etc.) followed by <code>:</code> and the message.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>$/</code></td>
                    <td>Choice separator (required before the custom response brackets)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <div class="info-box tip">
                <div class="info-box-title">Note</div>
                <p>Custom responses are <strong>completely optional</strong>. You don't need to add one to every choice—mix and match as needed. In the example above, the last choice has no custom response, which is perfectly valid.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>More Examples</h4>

<pre><code>mc : Hey, how was your day?
gf : It was okay... kind of boring. You?
$fake.choices =
Same here, nothing special. $/
I had a crazy day at work! $/ [gf : Oh really? Tell me everything!]
I missed you all day. $/ [gf : Aww, that's so sweet! 💕]

gf : Anyway, what should we have for dinner?</code></pre>

            <p>In this example, only 2 out of 3 choices trigger a custom response. The conversation then continues normally regardless of which choice was selected.</p>

            <h3>Real Choices (With Impact)</h3>
            <p>Here is an example of a choice-based feature that impacts the story:</p>

<pre><code>$choices =
A. Choice 1 $/
B. Choice 2 $/
C. Choice 3

path a
gf : We're in timeline 1!
gf : And look, it's even possible to direct you to a discussion that will only concern this path!
$talks = path1/example.txt
end path

path b
gf : We're in timeline 2!
$talks = path2/example.txt
end path

path c
gf : We're in timeline 3!
$talks = path3/example.txt
end path</code></pre>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Element</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>A.</code>, <code>B.</code>, <code>1.</code>, <code>2.</code>...</td>
                    <td>Prefix to identify the choice (will not appear visually when making the choice)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>path a</code> ... <code>end path</code></td>
                    <td>Opens the continuation for choice A, and ends the path</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Between these tags, you can create the conversation as you wish. You can even use <code>$talks = example.txt</code> to redirect the user to a discussion that only concerns that choice.</p>

            <p>If you don't call up a discussion, after "end path" the conversation will revert to being common to all choices for whatever you put after it.</p>
