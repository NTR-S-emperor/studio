gf : Hi, we're back in private mode. 

You'll notice that our conversation has been resumed; it doesn't create a new one, which is convenient for the player's experience.
mc : Indeed.
Girlfriend: And now, you'll see an InstaPics post appear.
$insta = ntspath/chapter1/Sarah/nts1.txt
gf : You can click on the notification to be redirected to it. You can also close the window or wait a few seconds for it to disappear.
mc : Thank you!
gf : OnlySlut works on the same principle, take a look.
$slut = lovepath/love1.txt
gf : A post on one of these apps doesn't necessarily have to include an image, as you can see with this OnlySlut post.
mc : That's handy, thanks!
gf : Earlier, I showed you that you can make choices in the dialogues, but they don't influence the story, they're just there for immersion.
gf : Now, you're going to have to make a choice from a list, and the rest of the story will be influenced by it.
$choices =
A. I want to start storyline A $/
B. I want to start storyline B $/
C. I want to start storyline C 

path a
gf : We're in story A!
mc : Awesome. 
gf : And look, I'm directing you to a new dialogue with Stéphane that only concerns choice A!
$talks = pathA/a.txt
end path

path b
gf : We're in story B!
mc : Awesome. 
gf : And look, I'm directing you to a new dialogue with Olivia that only concerns choice B!
$talks = pathB/b.txt
end path

path c
gf : We're in story C!
mc : Awesome. 
gf : And look, I'm taking you to a new dialogue with Lisa that only concerns choice c!
$talks = pathC/c.txt
