Robert, Girlfriend,
ro : Hi, you two, look, we can post status updates:
$status = Today
ro : Very handy for posting timelines in our conversations.
Girlfriend:  Thanks, by the way, I noticed that in a group conversation, the group image is automatically created based on the members in the group, which is handy.
ro : Yes, and it's also possible to let the player make choices in our conversations, choices that have no impact on the rest of the story:
$fake.choices =
Actually, that's nice for immersion. $/
It's fun. $/
I'm going to use that.
ro : It's also possible to notify the player that the last message sent will be deleted when they take their next action. This works for all types of messages (videos, photos, etc.).
$delete
ro : It's also possible to time this deletion in milliseconds. This message will be deleted automatically after 3 seconds:
$delete = 3000
mc : Very practical indeed.
gf : Okay, now we've covered group conversations, statuses, choices, and deletions.
gf : Next, we'll look at posts on OnlySlut or InstaPics.
