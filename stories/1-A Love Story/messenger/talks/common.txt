gf : We're back together, despite the choices you made before.
mc : Great, do we have to go back to a common point?
gf : No, not at all, choices can trigger scripted conversations, you just have to call a conversation in one place that isn't called in another place.
gf : That way, you can follow a different storyline.
mc : Thanks!
gf : And now, the lock system to move on to the next chapter.
gf : A higher-level code works for lower levels. 
gf : The lock below is gold level, so diamond and platinum levels work. Use the code “gold.”
gf : The codes entered are stored in memory but checked at each stage. If a code has changed, the user will have to re-enter it.
