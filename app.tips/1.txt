[b]Quick & automatic backup[/b]

A single click allows for quick saving.

A long click allows for quick saving but with a custom name.

Automatic saves are performed when a choice is presented to the player, after receiving media, and then during a new Messenger conversation. They are limited to 10. The oldest ones are overwritten.
